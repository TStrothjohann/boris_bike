#Boris Bikes 

We are building a system to manage the Boris Bike rental.

- It can keep track of a number of docking stations and the bikes

- It will allow users to rent the bikes and return them

- When the bikes brake they will be unavailable for rental.

- There will also be a garage to fix the bikes and a van to move the bikes between the stations and the garage.
